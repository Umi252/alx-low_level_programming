Bit manipulation, also known as bitwise operations, is a technique used in computer programming to manipulate individual bits or groups of bits within a byte or other unit of data. It involves using operators such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, left shift, right shift, and others to change the binary representation of data.

Bit manipulation is used in a variety of applications, such as optimizing code for performance, compressing data, encrypting data, and more. It can be particularly useful in systems with limited memory or processing power, where every bit counts.

Some common operations in bit manipulation include:

Setting a bit: This involves turning a specific bit to 1 within a byte or other unit of data, while leaving all other bits unchanged.
Clearing a bit: This involves turning a specific bit to 0 within a byte or other unit of data, while leaving all other bits unchanged.
Toggling a bit: This involves flipping the value of a specific bit within a byte or other unit of data, so that a 1 becomes a 0, and vice versa.
Checking a bit: This involves testing whether a specific bit within a byte or other unit of data is set to 1 or 0.
Shifting bits: This involves moving the bits within a byte or other unit of data to the left or right, which can be used to multiply or divide by powers of two.
